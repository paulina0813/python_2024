Variables

- When naming a variable, the name should describe the data they're storing
- Variable names shouldn't be too long
- Variable names shouldn't start with an upper case letter
- Variable names shouldn't start with a number or an underscore (or any other symbols or special characters)

There are 3 ways to declare Variables
1. camelCase = firstName -> the first word is all lowecase and the first letter of the next word in an upper case letter
2. snake_case / under_score = first_name -> the words are separated by an underscore
3. lowecase = firstname -> all the letters are lowercase

CONSTANTS
- Constants should be named using upper case letters
- Constant names shouldn't be too long
- Constant names shouldn't start with an upper case letter
- Constant names shouldn't start with a number or an underscore (or any other symbols or special characters)
