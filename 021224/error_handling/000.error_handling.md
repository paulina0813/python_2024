# Error Handling

In Python we have different types of errors:

- TypeError
- SyntaxError
- ZeroDivisionError
- IndexError
- KeyError
- Other

# try / except

It allows us to "try" to execute a block of code. If the code contains errors, we can handle them for the user with the "except" clause to catch common errors
