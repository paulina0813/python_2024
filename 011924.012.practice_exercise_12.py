'''
A bakery sells loaves of bread for â‚¬3.49 each. Bread that is not the same day has a 60% discount. Write a program that starts by reading the number of bars sold 
that are not of the day. Then the program must show the usual price of a loaf of bread, the discount given for not being fresh, and the total final cost.
