# Functional Programming

- It's working all our projects with *fucntions*
- It's dividing our problems in function packages
- It's creating a function module 

## Important

- Functions must be:
    - Clean
    - Understandable
    - Easy to expand
    - Easy to maintain
    - Efficient in their memory usage
    - DRY (don't repeat yourself)
    - KISS (keep it simple stupid)

# Function

Functions are small code segments that can be reutilized

They're composed of:

- **def** it's a reserved word that means "define"
- **function name** is the name that will be given to the function. Ideally, it's name should have meaning
- **()** parenthesis allow you to add parameters or arguments
- If the parenthesis are empty, you are not entering parameters
- **parameters** the name that is assigned to the parameters that will be considered in the function
    - example: (first_name, last_name)
- **arguments (args)** it's the value that will be assigned to the parameters in the function
    - example: ("Luis", "Guerra")
- **keywordarguments(kwargs)** allows you to pass optional arguments with variable length
