# Pillars of Object oriented programming (OOP)

## 1. Inheritance

A class can inherit (parent) a subclass (child)

- Python has multiple inheritance. It can inherit from multiple classes

## 2. Polymorphism

It refers to inhering a method in a class can act as either a parent or a child and they can do so interchangeably.

You can inherit a method but in the child class it can be overwritten or changed.

## 3. Encapsulation

It's about integrity (hiding information) for other classes.  Limit what pieces of your code can access. Make more things inaccessible, if they aren't needed.

- public = accessible for everyone, everywhere
- private = accessible within the same class
- protected = can't be accessed


## 4. Abstraction

Ommitting useless information and focusing only on what's useful
